# Web API Application

## Assignment Goals:
- Build a JavaScript application object.
- Learn to use an online JSON data web API.
- Use jQuery to get ajax data and show appropriate error messages if the data cannot be obtained.
- Use jQuery to dynamically add the data to the web page.
- Use Aria attributes in HTML to indicate dynamic data

## GitHub Repository
https://github.com/htc-ccis2591/web-api-app/

You’ll want to begin each assignment by forking the repository and cloning it locally.  When you are done, you’ll push to GitHub and submit a pull request.

## Web API
For this assignment, you may use any online web api that you would like.  If you do not want to find one yourself, you can use the Open Weather API that we used for the Simple Weather App.  However, you must use new API methods that we did not use in class.  

## Requirements
If you do not use the Open Weather API, you must send me your API key via email.  You should not put the key in a file stored on GitHub.

- A functional web application - No points will be awarded for a non-functional application.
- You must use at least three different web API methods in your application.  
- You must use jQuery to get the ajax data and provide an on screen (not an alert) message if the request for data fails.
- You must use Aria attributes correctly in your HTML to indicate where live data is used.

## Presentation
You must be present in class to present your project, or you may video record your presentation and post it to YouTube sending a link via Slack Chat for the class to watch your presentation.  

The presentation should be about 10 minutes long - more than 1 min shorter or longer will result in fewer points.  

The presentation must include:

- A quick overview of the web API chosen.  
- Show the three web API methods you chose to use, pointing out any required input and an overview of the JSON returned.
- A walkthrough of your application object and its properties and methods.
- A walkthrough of your HTML page, showing where the dynamic data is loaded.
- A demo of your working application.
